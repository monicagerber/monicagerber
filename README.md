Iâ€™m a statistical research associate at Fred Hutch in the Vaccine Immunology Statistical Center, located in Seattle, WA, where I analyze data for pre-clinical and clinical trials for vaccines. Previously I was a biostatistician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA.

I'm also a co-organizer of R-Ladies Seattle and a certified instructor with The Carpentries.
