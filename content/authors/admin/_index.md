I'm a data scientist and public health professional interested in using open source tools to understand and promote population health. I have worked at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) in the [Vaccine Immunology Statistical Center](https://www.cavd.org/grantees/Pages/Grantee-Gottardo.aspx), where I analyzed large laboratory assay and clinical datasets for vaccine research in HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease areas. Previously I was a biostatistician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Pediatrics and in the Center for Community Health Improvement.

In my free time, I enjoy volunteering with [R-Ladies Seattle](https://rladiesseattle.org/) and the Seattle [Mountaineers](https://www.mountaineers.org/).
