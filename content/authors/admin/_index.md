I'm a statistical research associate at Fred Hutch in the Vaccine Immunology Statistical Center ([VISC](https://www.cavd.org/grantees/Pages/Grantee-Gottardo.aspx)) where I analyze data for pre-clinical and early clinical trials for vaccines. Previously I was a biostatistician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA.

I am co-organizer of [R-Ladies Seattle](https://rladiesseattle.org/) and a certified instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
