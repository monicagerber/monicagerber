  I'm a Data Science Manager at [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org), where I lead a team using real-world data to dig into critical questions affecting cancer patients.
  I've worked on many public health issues from population mental health to vaccine development. I am also a rock climber, outdoor leader, person on a bike, and croissant connoisseur. ü•ê
  
  I use this website to share my thoughts on clinical data science, open science, and leadership.
